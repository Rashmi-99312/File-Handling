    "#Question 1: What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages.\n",
    "Compiled Languages\n",
    "Process: Source code → Compiler → Machine code (binary) → Executed directly by the CPU.\n",

    "#Question 2: What is exception handling in Python?\n",
    "ANS-Exception handling in Python is a way to deal with errors gracefully so your program doesn’t crash when something unexpected happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Question 3: What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
    "Ans -Closing files\n",
    "-Releasing resources (e.g., database connections, network sockets)\n",
    "-Freeing memory or locks\n",
    "\n",
    "#Question 4:What is logging in Python?\n",
    "Ans-Logging in Python is a way to record messages about what your program is doing — useful for debugging, monitoring, and auditing. \n",
    "\n",
    "#question 5:What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",

    "#Question 7:How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
    "Ans-ZeroDivisionError → dividing by zero.\n",

    "-FileNotFoundError → accessing a missing file.\n",
    "\n",
    "#question 8: What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python\n",
    "ANS-Its main purpose is to ensure proper acquisition and release of resources automatically — without needing to explicitly call close().\n",

    "#question 9:What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
    "ANS- Multithreading:\n",
    "-Uses multiple threads within a single process.\n",
    "-Threads share the same memory space.\n",
    "-Best for I/O-bound tasks.\n",
    "-Limited in Python by the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) — only one thread runs Python bytecode at a time.\n",
    "-Example use cases:\n",
    "    Reading/writing files concurrently.\n",
    "    Handling many client requests in a web server.\n",
    "    Downloading multiple URLs at once.\n",
    "\n",
    " Multiprocessing:\n",
    "-Uses multiple processes.\n",

    "#Question 12:What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
    "Ans-Write risky code in try.\n",

    "- Use finally for cleanup.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Question 13:Why is memory management important in Python\n",
    "ANS-Even though Python manages memory automatically with its memory manager and garbage collector.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Question 14:F What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
    "ANS-try Block\n",
    "The try block is where you place risky code — code that might raise an error.\n",
    "Python monitors the code inside try.\n",
    "If no error occurs → the program continues normally.\n",
    "If an error occurs → Python looks for a matching except block.\n",
    "\n",
    "except Block:\n",
    "The except block defines how to respond when a specific exception happens.\n",
    "It prevents the program from crashing and lets you handle errors gracefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Question 15:What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling\n",
    "ANS-In Python, the else block in a try-except statement is optional and is used to execute code that should run only if no exception occurs in the try block.\n",

    "Reads the entire file (or a specified number of characters) at once.\n",
    "Returns a string containing all content.\n",
    "\n",
    "File.readline()\n",
    "  Reads one line at a time from the file.\n",
    "  Useful for large files or when processing line by line.\n",

    "\n",
    "#Question 20: What is the logging module in Python used for?\n",

    "\n",
    "#Question 21: What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?\n",
    "Ans-The os module in Python provides a way to interact with the operating system, including file and directory operations. In file handling, it’s used to perform tasks that go beyond basic reading and writing, such as creating, deleting, renaming, or checking files and directories.\n",
